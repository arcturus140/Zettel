**CONTEXT** [[20211118010533]] Zettel template v2.1

A Zettel has three parts: a header, a body, and a footer.  The header starts with an optional YAML header and includes a level 1 (H1) header with a timestamp ID and a title; a list of hashtag keywords; and a CONTEXT line that links to a Zettel that this Zettel continues or comments (or raises a question about) on an aspect of that Zettel (if there such a Zettel). This text is part of the body. Footnotes and endnotes become links in the body to other Zettels. That leaves the References section for the footer. The References section below can be omitted, generated with a references manager such as Zotero and a YAML header [[20211118010533]] Zettel template v2.1; or added by hand, as below. 

-   This Zettel format only applies to Zettlr 2.0.3 + Pandoc 2.16.1 + MikTeX 21.2-x64 + Zotero 5.0.96.3 + BetterBibTex  5.6.8 under Windows 10 and has not been tested with other software.  
-   Filenames have the format `timestamp.md` in my implementation.
-   Every Zettel is a note. Literature and Permanent notes considered harmful (Ahrens 2017, anonymous 2021). 

The following checklist in Markdown is a first attempt (Gawande 2010). 

- [ ] Replace the header timestamp ID with your own ID. 
- [ ] Replace the title with your title.
- [ ] Replace the hashtags above with your own #hashtag keywords
- [ ] Replace the link after the **CONTEXT** keyword with a link to a Zettel Z such that this Zettel   
    - [ ] continues Z; or
    - [ ] comments on an aspect of Zettel Z or raises a question on an aspect of Zettel Z; or
    - [ ] if there is no such prior Zettel Z, and this Zettel starts a new topic, remove the **CONTEXT** line entirely. 
- [ ] Replace the body (including this cheklist) with own text and Markdown in the body. 
- [ ] Are there footnotes or endnotes? 
    - [ ] Footnotes and endnotes become links within the body to other Zettels. 
- [ ] If there are literature citations from a citation manager (Zotero is assumed here) 
    - [ ] Add citations Pandoc format. 
        - [ ] Verify that the Zotero Citation Database is exported in CSL JSON format and specified in Preferences → Export → Citation Database;
        - [ ] Add a YAML header to beginning of this document (see [[20211118010533]] Zettel template v2.1); or
    - [ ] A references section can be added by hand, as below.
